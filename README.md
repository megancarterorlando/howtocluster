# How to Cluster in ESIP
Recommendations based on past experiences and community input to aid ESIP cluster leaders in proposing, leading, and spinning down clusters.

## Why
ESIP clusters are community-led and community-driven endeavors. While cluster goals can vary widely, past experience has shown that there are some common elements and processes that, when included or considered, lead to more effective collaborations. We share these recommendations with cluster leaders as a form of scaffolding [1] that is meant to help leaders get collaborations off on the right foot, so to speak, and proceed successfully.

## How to contribute
If you would like to suggest changes or additions, please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/megancarterorlando/howtocluster/issues) to document your request. If you just want to discuss, please reach out to ESIP staff at staff@esipfed.org.

## Why start an ESIP Cluster?
Do you have an Earth science data-related challenge or opportunity that you think other ESIP community members would be interested in tackling? Would your project benefit from accessing the ESIP backbone framework for collaboration? An ESIP cluster may be just what you need. If you are undecided about whether to start an ESIP cluster, share your initial idea with the ESIP-all Mailing List or with the ESIP Slack Channel to see what other ESIP community participants think. You are always welcome to contact staff@esipfed.org to discuss as well.

## Who can propose an ESIP Cluster?
Anyone who is employed by an ESIP Partner Organization. Not sure if your organization is an ESIP Partner? Contact staff@esipfed.org.

## Collaboration Area Chair Responsibilities
When considering whether to propose a cluster or whether to continue in a leadership role for a collaboration area, please consider carefully the responsibilities of a collaboration area chair. For a Cluster or other Collaboration Area to function successfully, it must have a chair who takes the lead in goal-setting, planning, advertising, facilitating, and documenting group activities. It is not a trivial time commitment. ESIP staff can help the chair by providing advice and other support as outlined in this document, for example in disseminating news about group activities and outputs, but staff will not takeover the duties of a chair. The recruitment of 1-2 co-chairs is strongly advised, as well as additional delegation of tasks. For a full-list of Collaboration Area Chair responsibilities, see https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/10647226. It is recommended that chairs give careful thought to their ability to continue chair-ship each year. For some clusters as for committees, it has also worked well to elect a new chair at least every 2 years.


[1] Scaffolding encompasses supportive information, activities, and processes aimed at lowering barriers to participation. In this case, the scaffolding is intended to lower the burden for and empower ESIP cluster leaders in particular. Read more about the concept of scaffolding at https://zenodo.org/records/6078934.
