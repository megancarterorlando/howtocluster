# How to Cluster in ESIP
Recommendations based on past experiences and community input to aid ESIP cluster leaders in proposing, leading, and spinning down clusters.

## Why
ESIP clusters are community-led and community-driven endeavors. While cluster goals can vary widely, past experience has shown that there are some common elements and processes that, when included or considered, lead to more effective collaborations. We share these recommendations with cluster leaders as a form of scaffolding [1] that is meant to help leaders get collaborations off on the right foot, so to speak, and proceed successfully.

## How to contribute

[1] Scaffolding encompasses supportive information, activities, and processes aimed at lowering barriers to participation. In this case, the scaffolding is intended to lower the burden for and empower ESIP cluster leaders in particular. Read more about the concept of scaffolding at https://zenodo.org/records/6078934.
