# How to Cluster in ESIP
Recommendations based on past experiences and community input to aid ESIP cluster leaders in proposing, leading, and spinning down clusters.

## Why
ESIP clusters are community-led and community-driven endeavors. While cluster goals can vary widely, past experience has shown that there are some common elements and processes that, when included or considered, lead to more effective collaborations. We share these recommendations with cluster leaders as a form of scaffolding [1] that is meant to help leaders get collaborations off on the right foot, so to speak, and proceed successfully.

## How to contribute
If you would like to suggest changes or additions, please use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/megancarterorlando/howtocluster/issues) to document your request. If you just want to discuss, please reach out to ESIP staff at staff@esipfed.org.

## Why start an ESIP Cluster?
Do you have an Earth science data-related challenge or opportunity that you are interested in working on with others in ESIP? Would your project benefit from utilizing the ESIP backbone framework for collaboration? An ESIP cluster may be just what you need. If you are undecided about whether to start an ESIP cluster, share your initial idea the ESIP Slack Workspace to see what other ESIP community participants think. You are always welcome to contact staff@esipfed.org to discuss as well.

## Who can propose an ESIP Cluster?
Anyone who is employed by an ESIP Partner Organization. Not sure if your organization is an ESIP Partner? Contact staff@esipfed.org. Clusters are typically proposed by multiple individuals who wish to collaborate. In that case, only one of the initial proposers needs to be affiliated with a partner organization.

## Collaboration Area Chair Responsibilities
When considering whether to propose a cluster, please consider carefully the responsibilities of leadership. For a cluster or other Collaboration Area to function successfully, it must have a chair who takes the lead in goal-setting, planning, advertising, facilitating, and documenting group activities. It is not a trivial time committment. ESIP staff can help the chair by providing advice and other support as outlined in this document, for example in disseminating news about group activities and outputs, but staff will not take over the duties of a chair or act in a project management capacity. The recruitment of 1-2 co-chairs is strongly advised, as well as additional delegation of tasks. For a full-list of Collaboration Area Chair responsibilities, see https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/10647226. It is recommended that chairs give careful thought to their ability to continue chair-ship each year. For many clusters, it has worked well to elect a new chair roughly every 2 years.

## How to propose an ESIP Cluster (ESIP Cluster Lifecycle: Proposal Phase)
To propose an ESIP cluster, send an email to ESIP’s Vice President (vp@esipfed.org). Although many details may not yet be determined, your email should include as much as you can describe about the following:

    • Name of proposed cluster
    • Names and email addresses of initial participants
    • Name of initial chairperson and co-chairperson (if identified)
    • Preliminary description of cluster and cluster goals (see section on Setting Cluster Goals)
            o What is the motivation for forming the cluster? What will success look like for the cluster in terms of goals and outputs? What is the anticipated timeline for                     achieving your goals? If known, how does the cluster fit in with or how will it interact with others? How is this proposed work related to your day job? Is your                    employer supportive of your involvement in this?
    • Description of support needed from ESIP staff
    
## What to expect after you have proposed an ESIP Cluster (ESIP Cluster Lifecycle: Start-Up Phase)
Once your requested cluster has been approved, an ESIP staff member will contact you to let you know and to ask you about what ESIP collaborative tools you need. The basic collaborative support provided to clusters by ESIP staff includes a dedicated mailing list, access to GoToMeeting for telecons, a Wiki Page, and a place on the ESIP website that briefly describes your cluster that links to your Wiki page and other communication tools. Add-ons may include a dedicated Slack Channel, a GitHub Repo, access to
ESIP’s Amazon Web Services capabilities, and more.

## Populating Your Cluster Webpage
One important step before advertising your cluster to the broader community is to put some content on your cluster Wiki page. This page should at least state in a paragraph or two what was in the preliminary description of the cluster that you provided upon proposal (see section on How to Propose an ESIP Cluster). Think about what information a person would need to decide whether to get involved in your cluster or even to simply join the mailing list. Be sure to include the nuts and bolts of how to get involved, including how to join the mailing list, who to contact for questions, when your telecons take place (once known), etc. You should also include a link to your running notes document and a link to your preliminary Cluster Plan (see section on Setting Cluster Goals below). You should aim to update your Wiki page periodically and you are welcome to appoint a specific person to do this over time.

## Scheduling & Advertising Your First Telecon
Once your collaborative tools are in place and you are pleased with your cluster Wiki page, it is up to you to choose a time for a first telecon for your cluster. You may wish to have a brainstorming session with your co-chair(s) or with a few targeted invitees to develop a strategy for the early phase of the cluster prior to inviting others in or you may wish to wait to see who turns up and is likely to be involved in the cluster before developing a further strategy. If your initial telecon is open to all, please share event details with the Community Director at least 10 days in advance so that the call can be advertised more broadly within the ESIP Community.

## ESIP Cluster Life Cycle: Active Phase
Active phase is defined as all activities happening during and after the first meeting of the cluster. Goal- setting is included in active phase, though it may be something that starts even prior to proposal of the cluster. The idea is that goals cannot be solidified until you know who will take part in the cluster and
what they hope to get out of participation.

## Setting Cluster Goals
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to running a cluster, nor will ESIP staff rigidly prescribe how you work. Likely you formed a cluster around an Earth science data challenge or opportunity, so you should find the structure and format that best helps you take steps toward addressing the challenge or opportunity. With past clusters, it has been observed that those groups that set concrete and measurable goals are most likely to reach their goals, as well as to attract and retain active participants. Break larger goals down into smaller sub-goals, so you have smaller, but more frequent, milestones to celebrate. Lay these goals out clearly in a succinct cluster plan (copy template available at http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Cluster_Plan_Template). The plan should be shared with all cluster members and linked on the cluster’s main Wiki page, as well as reviewed and updated twice a year, with assistance from the Community Director if desired. The most ideal times to review and update your cluster plan may be just after the Winter and Summer ESIP Meetings because it is likely that some of the activities from the meeting may have helped you to refine future directions. When a new cluster is first started, the chairs may draft an initial plan that is then refined through subsequent cluster events. Some examples of concrete goals that have been set by clusters include the development of guidelines orwhite papers, webinar series, and more.

## Electing Cluster Chairs and Co-Chairs
Individuals who propose an ESIP cluster typically start off in the position of cluster chair and co-chair(s).
A cluster should elect a new chair and 1-2 co-chairs every 1-2 years. Elections can take place by a simple
majority vote on a cluster telecon or can be more formally run through an electronic platform with
assistance from ESIP staff. At a minimum, notification of an election should be sent to the cluster mailing
list at least a week in advance of the election, final results should also be shared via the mailing list, and
ESIP staff should be notified of changes as well. When considering whether to run for chair of a cluster,
individuals should take into account the factors described in the Collaboration Area Chair
Responsibilities section above. An individual who has rotated off as Chair of a cluster can still remain
very active in the group.

## Scheduling Regular Cluster Telecons
For most clusters, monthly hour-long telecons are the primary event and communication pathway for cluster progress. Your cluster may choose to meet more frequently. Often, it works well to set the call on a recurring schedule (e.g., on the first Tuesday of the month at 1 pm ET), so that meetings are predictable. When identifying a regular time slot, please try to avoid times that conflict with other ESIP collaboration area calls, as shown on the ESIP Community Calendar at https://esipfed.org/telecons. Once an ideal time slot has been identified, notify the Community Director, so that the virtual connection info can be generated and details can be shared on the ESIP Community Calendar.

[1] Scaffolding encompasses supportive information, activities, and processes aimed at lowering barriers to participation. In this case, the scaffolding is intended to lower the burden for and empower ESIP cluster leaders in particular. Read more about the concept of scaffolding at https://zenodo.org/records/6078934.
